New beginnings:


main execution-



training-

1. get a set of face and non-face images
2. modified adaboost to both select features for a stage and the thersholds of those features
3. save the stages of a trained cascade in a xml file to read later for detecting faces



detecting-

1. a function that parses through all the image sub-windows
2. read a trianed cascade from an xml file
3. in each subwindow evaluate with all cascade stages in sequence i.e., execution only goes to next stage if passed from current stage
4. reject subwindow immediately if subwindow failed at any stage
5. return the subwindow as face detected if it passes through all stages
